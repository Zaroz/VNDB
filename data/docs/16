 <dt>Names</dt><dd>
  People involved in visual novels production are often hide behind multiple
  aliases. These aliases could be listed here. Add only aliases that are
  actually used in VN credits.  Sometimes names with different Japanese spelling
  are romanized equally. You may add such aliases, but then original spelling
  should be used when name is being looked up in the VN staff edit form.<br />
  <br />
  One of the aliases can be selected as the primary name of the staff entry.
  Typically this is either the person's true name (if known, and if the person
  has used their true name in the context of VNs) or, alternatively, the most
  widely used alias.<br />
  <br />
  For each alias, the romaji field should contain the name in Latin alphabet.
  The original name should contain the name as it is written in the original
  script, and should be left blank if the name is already in the Latin
  alphabet. Check out the <a href="/d5">general editing guidelines</a> for
  information on name order and romanization. If possible, try to include a
  space between the given name and the surname.
